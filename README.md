Hi!
===
I'm [Viacheslav](https://github.com/ViacheslavIT) and I'm very exciting to join
to this very interesting backend cours.

I finished [**first task**](https://github.com/kottans/backend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md)
and I want to share my impression about this before start
[**next one**](https://github.com/kottans/backend/blob/master/tasks/unix-shell.md)

I got a lot of new information about basics things for Git and I will use these
knowledges next times in my work.

I hope, I will finish all tasks in time )))

Best regards!

**P.S.** Sorry, but I haven't any cats)))

## Unix Shell ##
It was very interesting - to study [**Unix Shell**](https://github.com/kottans/backend/blob/master/tasks/unix-shell.md).

I knew some commands and I had used aliases earlier, but I got more new knowleges after this cours.

I had learnt more new commands and also I had got basic experience with shell scripts

I surely will use a lot of commands in my tasks and also I will apply shell scripts and I want get more info about these powerfull features
